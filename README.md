# Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing Portfolio

## Professional Summary

I am a dedicated student and practitioner of Offensive Security, specializing in the identification, exploitation, and professional documentation of security vulnerabilities in web applications and network infrastructure. This repository functions as a technical portfolio, showcasing practical skills acquired through formal training and hands-on laboratory exercises.

The focus of this work is to demonstrate proficiency in core penetration testing methodologies, emphasizing clear technical reporting and systematic vulnerability analysis.

## Core Technical Skills

| Category | Proficiency and Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Web Application Security** | In-depth understanding and exploitation of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, including Blind SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure authentication, and logic flaws. |
| **Penetration Testing Tools** | **Burp Suite** (Proficient in Repeater, Scanner, and Intruder for automated attacks), Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Dirb/Gobuster, and network analysis tools. |
| **Scripting and Automation** | Python (Developing custom scripts for exploit writing, data manipulation, and task automation), Bash/Shell scripting. |
| **Methodologies** | Adherence to industry standards such as the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and systematic vulnerability scoring (CVSS). |
| **Operating Environments** | Expertise in Kali Linux, Windows Server, and setting up isolated virtual laboratory environments (VMware/VirtualBox). |

## Projects and Technical Writeups
